# alisters-note-taker

## Description
An application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
The application’s front end has already been created, this task is to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
